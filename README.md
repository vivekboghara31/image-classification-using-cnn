## Dataset Overview  

The dataset consists of labeled images divided into training and testing sets:  

- **Training Data**:  
  - **Dogs**: Four thousand images  
  - **Cats**: Four thousand images  

- **Testing Data**:  
  - **Dogs**: One thousand images  
  - **Cats**: One thousand images  

Additionally, a **Single Prediction Dataset** is provided to test the trained model on unseen data.  

## Preprocessing  

All images have been resized to **64x64 pixels** for consistency and optimal training performance. Ensure any additional preprocessing aligns with the specific requirements of your machine learning model.
